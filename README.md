# CUDA_MNIST

A GPU-accelerated implementation of a neural network for the MNIST digit classification task using CUDA and C/C++.

## About

This project demonstrates how to build a simple neural network for digit recognition (MNIST dataset) with GPU acceleration using CUDA. It includes custom CUDA kernels, data loading in C/C++/Python, and training / inference logic.

## Features

- Custom CUDA kernels for forward and backward propagation  
- Integration of host-side code (C/C++ / Python) with GPU execution  
- Simple MLP (multi-layer perceptron) architecture for MNIST  
- Ability to train from scratch or load precomputed weights  
- Demonstrates low-level GPU programming concepts (memory management, kernel launches, synchronization)
